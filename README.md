I wrote this code back when I started learning about neural networks. 
I was striving to comprehend and gain intuition for deep learning 
and how neural networks learn. As a result, I created this code from 
scratch using C, in which I implemented the fundamental functions for
neural networks, including 'NN_FORWARD,' 'NN_LOSS,' and 'NN_BACKPROP'....
By constructing my own neural network framework in C, I managed 
to grasp the foundational concepts and inner workings of these potent models.
